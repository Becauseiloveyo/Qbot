# Qbot Task Progress

Last updated: 2026-09-20
Architecture: Qbot Architecture v1.2 FINAL
Current milestone: v0.1 — Spec + durable core model
Current branch: `feature/android-agent-persistence`

## Current objective

Finish the common contracts and conformance rules that both Android and Desktop implementations must follow before either runtime diverges.

## Completed

- Repository initialized.
- Architecture frozen as **Qbot Architecture v1.2 FINAL**.
- Persistent handoff files added:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `TASK_PROGRESS.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/ROADMAP.md`
  - `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Dual runtime strategy fixed:
  - Android: Kotlin / Compose / Room / recoverable event-driven execution.
  - Desktop: Python / FastAPI / SQLite WAL / NapCat-OneBot.
- Durable Task Engine model defined.
- Step checkpoint recovery defined.
- Persistent AgentRun model defined.
- Transactional Outbox with `SENDING_UNKNOWN` recovery defined.
- Input/output idempotency requirements defined.
- Per-conversation serialization defined.
- Hybrid memory + memory staging/provenance defined.
- Prompt-injection and memory-poisoning trust boundary defined.
- Safe Mode, backup, migration, and event journal requirements defined.
- Multi-node single-writer design defined: lease + fencing token + optimistic concurrency.
- Initial common JSON schemas added:
  - normalized event;
  - task/task step;
  - checkpoint;
  - agent run;
  - action proposal;
  - memory;
  - outbox;
  - policy decision;
  - journal event;
  - transport capabilities.
- State machines and invariants documented in `docs/STATE_MACHINES.md`.
- Conformance fixtures added:
  - durable task restore before reasoning;
  - ambiguous external send reconciliation without blind replay.
- All current JSON schema/fixture files were parsed successfully as valid JSON.
- Executable conformance validator added with JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 checks and cross-record invariants.
- GitHub Actions conformance workflow added for Python 3.12.

## In progress

- Tighten cross-schema invariants that JSON Schema alone does not express.
- Define v0.1 persistence mapping so Android Room and Desktop SQLite use equivalent semantics.
- Expand executable invariant coverage beyond the first two conformance fixtures.

## Not started

- Desktop runtime implementation.
- NapCat/OneBot transport.
- Android application skeleton.
- Android QQ transport adapters.
- LLM router.
- Persona/contact UI.
- Memory retrieval implementation.
- Coordinator and phone/PC synchronization.
- Full management UI.

## v0.1 exit criteria

v0.1 is complete when:

- Common schemas exist for all core persistent/interchange records.
- Task, TaskStep, AgentRun, and Outbox transitions are documented and machine-tested.
- Idempotency, ordering, recovery, trust, and schema-version rules are explicit.
- Conformance fixtures cover normal resume and ambiguous send recovery.
- A small validator can check fixtures and required invariants.
- Android and Desktop persistence mappings are documented.
- No runtime implementation depends on undocumented chat context.

## Known decisions

- No LangChain/LangGraph runtime dependency in v0.x.
- LangGraph-style durable execution concepts are implemented directly.
- No Redis/PostgreSQL/vector DB in the first usable version.
- NapCat is a Desktop transport, not an Android transport.
- Android execution is recoverable/event-driven instead of assuming a permanent daemon.
- Active tasks are loaded directly, not discovered through RAG.
- LLM output is an `ActionProposal`; deterministic validators/policy/executors own side effects.
- Multi-node automatic failover is not enabled until a coordinator can provide a fencing epoch.

## Next concrete actions

1. Add persistence mapping document for Room and Desktop SQLite.
2. Add journal/idempotency invariant tests.
3. Run the conformance validator in CI and fix any schema/invariant failures.
4. When v0.1 contracts pass, begin Desktop v0.2 runtime skeleton.

## Resume rule

A new AI session must read this file before coding and continue from the first unfinished concrete action unless the user explicitly changes priority.
