# Qbot Task Progress

Last updated: 2026-09-20
Architecture: Qbot Architecture v1.2 FINAL
Current milestone: v0.1 — Spec + durable core model
Current branch: `feature/android-agent-persistence`

## Current objective

Finish the common contracts and conformance rules that both Android and Desktop implementations must follow before either runtime diverges.

## Completed

- Repository initialized.
- Architecture frozen as **Qbot Architecture v1.2 FINAL**.
- Persistent handoff files added:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `TASK_PROGRESS.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/ROADMAP.md`
  - `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Dual runtime strategy fixed:
  - Android: Kotlin / Compose / Room / recoverable event-driven execution.
  - Desktop: Python / FastAPI / SQLite WAL / NapCat-OneBot.
- Durable Task Engine model defined.
- Step checkpoint recovery defined.
- Persistent AgentRun model defined.
- Transactional Outbox with `SENDING_UNKNOWN` recovery defined.
- Input/output idempotency requirements defined.
- Per-conversation serialization defined.
- Hybrid memory + memory staging/provenance defined.
- Prompt-injection and memory-poisoning trust boundary defined.
- Safe Mode, backup, migration, and event journal requirements defined.
- Multi-node single-writer design defined: lease + fencing token + optimistic concurrency.
- Initial common JSON schemas added:
  - normalized event;
  - task/task step;
  - checkpoint;
  - agent run;
  - action proposal;
  - memory;
  - outbox;
  - policy decision;
  - journal event;
  - transport capabilities.
- State machines and invariants documented in `docs/STATE_MACHINES.md`.
- Conformance fixtures added:
  - durable task restore before reasoning;
  - ambiguous external send reconciliation without blind replay.
- All current JSON schema/fixture files were parsed successfully as valid JSON.
- Executable conformance validator added with JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 checks and cross-record invariants.
- GitHub Actions conformance workflow added for Python 3.12.
- `docs/PERSISTENCE.md` now defines equivalent Room/Desktop SQLite keys, transactions, optimistic concurrency, fencing, Outbox, journal, and migration semantics.
- Added conformance fixtures for duplicate inbound events, duplicate Outbox dedupe keys, stale writer epochs, stale Task versions, and journal ordering.
- Validator expanded to check those idempotency, fencing, versioning, checkpoint, and journal invariants.
- Draft PR #1 opened as the v0.1 validation/review surface.

## In progress

- Run the expanded conformance suite through GitHub Actions and fix any failures.
- Tighten any remaining cross-schema invariants exposed by CI.

## Not started

- Desktop runtime implementation.
- NapCat/OneBot transport.
- Android application skeleton.
- Android QQ transport adapters.
- LLM router.
- Persona/contact UI.
- Memory retrieval implementation.
- Coordinator and phone/PC synchronization.
- Full management UI.

## v0.1 exit criteria

v0.1 is complete when:

- Common schemas exist for all core persistent/interchange records.
- Task, TaskStep, AgentRun, and Outbox transitions are documented and machine-tested.
- Idempotency, ordering, recovery, trust, and schema-version rules are explicit.
- Conformance fixtures cover normal resume and ambiguous send recovery.
- A small validator can check fixtures and required invariants.
- Android and Desktop persistence mappings are documented.
- No runtime implementation depends on undocumented chat context.

## Known decisions

- No LangChain/LangGraph runtime dependency in v0.x.
- LangGraph-style durable execution concepts are implemented directly.
- No Redis/PostgreSQL/vector DB in the first usable version.
- NapCat is a Desktop transport, not an Android transport.
- Android execution is recoverable/event-driven instead of assuming a permanent daemon.
- Active tasks are loaded directly, not discovered through RAG.
- LLM output is an `ActionProposal`; deterministic validators/policy/executors own side effects.
- Multi-node automatic failover is not enabled until a coordinator can provide a fencing epoch.

## Next concrete actions

1. Confirm PR #1 GitHub Actions conformance result and fix any failures.
2. If CI passes, mark v0.1 contracts stable for implementation.
3. Begin Desktop v0.2 runtime skeleton: package layout, SQLite WAL bootstrap, configuration, and MockTransport.
4. Add NapCat/OneBot transport only after the Desktop core can pass the shared conformance contracts.

## Resume rule

A new AI session must read this file before coding and continue from the first unfinished concrete action unless the user explicitly changes priority.
